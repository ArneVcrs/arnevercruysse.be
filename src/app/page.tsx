      <p>Hey there, thanks for stopping by! I&apos;m Arne.</p>
      <p>
        This site is my personal little corner of the internet: a place where I can share my thoughts on my blog, 
        showcase my portfolio, and expirement with new ideas. It&apos;s a work in progress, I will be adding more content as I find the time.
      </p>
      <p>Go take a look around and don&apos;t hesitate to get in touch!</p>
      <p>The homepage is quite empty, for now...</p>
